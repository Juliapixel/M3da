# M3DFEA Modifification Guides
This folder contains various guides mostly targeted towards users with little-to-no development experience, intended to aid them in modifying their user experience when using M3DFEA.

Each of these guides, if applicable, has its own corresponding git branch, where examples of the modifications were applied. You can download and compile them if you wish to see the changes yourself.

To get started you must first become familiar with how to compile this program directly, please follow [the building guide](building.md).

> [!WARNING]
> All modifications made when following these tutorials must be done inside the Microsoft Visual Studio editor. Failing to do so will most likely cause **very** annoying compilation errors.
