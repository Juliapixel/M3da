# Guides
This folder contains various guides mostly targeted towards users with little-to-no development experience, intended to aid them in modifying their user experience when using M3DFEA.

Each of these guides, if applicable, has its own corresponding git branch, where examples of the modifications were applied. You can download them and compile them if you wish to see the changes yourself.

In order to get started you must become familiar with how to compile this program directly, please follow [this guide](building.md).
